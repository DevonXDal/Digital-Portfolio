    <p-tabView class="w-full">
        <p-tabPanel header="Professional" class="bg-primary text-lg">
          <p class="mb-3">I recently graduated from <span class="fancy-underline" title="West Virginia University at Parkersburg">WVUP</span> (May 2023) with a bachelors in software engineering. I had a 4.0 GPA for my associate degree in computer science and a 3.9 GPA for my bachelors. Now that I have graduated I am continuing to improve my skills, particularly with getting better at Angular and learning React.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">Most of my related learning started back in 2017 when I went to the Caperton Center during my junior and senior high school years for Computer System Repair. As time progressed, I went from barely participating in any of the hands-on projects that needed to be completed for the Caperton Center's staff to participating in every project I had the time for. This led to me being awarded a plaque: 'Outstanding Senior 2019.' In the two year span that I went to the Caperton Center, I had joined the <span class="fancy-underline" title="National Technical Honors Society">NTHS</span>, received <span class="fancy-underline" title="National Occupational Competency and Testing Institute">NOCTI</span> competency credential, and got nine certifications.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">During my associate degree, I learned at least some degree of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, Python, Dart, and most importantly, C# (.NET Core 2.1+). During my sophomore year, I discovered that I wanted to do web development following my graduation. In my capstone class, I studied for and got my <span class="fancy-underline" title="Microsoft Technology Associate">MTA</span> for Software Development Fundamentals During the second half of my sophomore year and into the following summer, I partipated in the college's LearnAndEarn program as student worker intern and worked to create a customer-facing web portal for the college's Reverse Makerspace. In this project, I designed most parts of the system, spoke with the domain experts for feedback, and carried out the development and deployment (Docker and Jenkins) of the system.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">During my bachelors degree, I learned at least some degree of Rust, TypeScript, Blazor, Angular, and SCSS. I massively improved my design documentation skills by learning many design patterns, building larger and more complex <span class="fancy-underline" title="Unified Modeling Language">UML</span> diagrams, data dictionaries, strict and concise language, etc. I also learned introductory level project management skills, which led to me getting the CompTIA Project+ certification. I focused heavily on developing my web development skills, learning not only how to build monolithic web systems but also microservices.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">My most complex but finished project from my college years was the <span class="fancy-underline" title="Customers pay to have makerspace employees use tools such as 3D printers to create various items they want">Reverse Makerspace</span> system. However, even though it was never fully realized due to the extent of work required, my most complex project was my bachelors' capstone. This project included many diagrams and design documentation that was over 200 pages in length. It was meant to be a school messanger app system that was planned to be immensibly customizable and extensible, allowing the userbase to write extensions that mostly could be shared amongst each other to add functionality to their apps that may not otherwise be available. Part of the immense complexity for this project came as it required a web application, a mobile app template, and an extension transpiler. The web application had a mostly working build process that would run on background threads to build the custom mobile apps for each school. The transpiler used a special script that was a bit of a mix between a strict naming syntax and both Bash and Python. The theoretical (never built to its full completion) transpiler was designed to support anything from web data retrieval and display to simple games such as minesweeper or battleship. The app was meant to run through the web, Android, and iOS. Even though it was never finished, it pushed my software engineering skills to a much higher level.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">Now that I have graduated I am continuing to improve my skills, particularly with getting better at Angular and learning React, while I look for work. I am looking for either in-person/hybrid work within the <span class="fancy-underline" title="Mid-Ohio Valley">MOV</span> or remote work for somewhere in the US. I plan to start out as preferebly a backend .NET developer or full-stack web developer, and my goal is to be a software architect in ten years.</p>

          <h3 class="font-bold text-xl">Activities</h3>
          <p class="mb-3">While most of my free time is spent playing video games (particularly strategy games) either alone or with friends, I do have a lot of other hobbies. In terms of outdoor activities, I enjoy going on walks or hikes, riding my bicycle, and playing either mini golf or disk golf. In terms of inside activities, I enjoy spending time with my dog, Eevee, and playing board games.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">My weekends is when I spend most of my time with family and friends. Saturdays tend to include hanging out with friends for game days or playing DND. My Sundays tend to be spent with my other family members and includes playing arcade games or board games.</p>

      <!-- Soft Skills -->
      <h3 class="font-bold text-xl">Soft Skills:</h3>
      <h4 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-2">Problem Solving</h4>
      <p class="mb-3">I am really good about repeatedly sitting there and trying to ways to make a breakthrough when my friends, classmates, and I get stuck trying to figure out an issue. If I am unable to figure out a solution with a certain method, I am quick in discovering and trying out different methods to find the solution to any software engineering problem that I run into.</p>

      <h4 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-2">Having a Growth Mindset</h4>
      <p class="mb-3">I enjoy spending time trying to learn new programming languages, tools, and frameworks. As this digital portfolio is being developed, I am learning more Angular, React, Tauri, Svelte, Auth0, and TailwindCSS. I am quick to try new things when what I am currently using fails to meet my needs.</p>

      <h4 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-2">Being Responsive</h4>
      <p class="mb-3">I rarely take longer than two days to respond to email and rarely more than a few hours to reply to direct messages. I aim to quick in my ability to respond to new messages and take on new tasks and am known to stop what I am doing to help classmates and friends with any issues they run into.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mt-12">Outstanding Senior of 2019:</h3>
      <p class="mb-3">This was awarded due to my participation in most of the optional class projects during my time at the Caperton Center. I set up laptop carts, troubleshooted problems for teachers and students, found the missing file for a program that then allowed the EMS/firefighter students use the full capabilities of the 911 operator simulator (which they previously could only talk and write notes with), etc. I also completed the largest number of certifications of any student in the class.</p>

      <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mt-12">NOCTI Workforce Competency Credential for Computer Repair Technology [Expired Janaury 2022]:</h3>
      <p class="mb-3">This was an exam the rest of the class and I took during my senior year of high school and second year at the Caperton Center. To get the credential, a student must had received a 70% or better. I got an 85% which was the highest in the class for that year.</p>

      <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mt-12">CareerSafe OSHA 10-Hour General Industry:</h3>
      <p class="mb-3">As a requirement for each Caperton Center class, students had to go through the 10 hour training material for General Industry OSHA regulations. I received this certificate of completion for completing the training.</p>
