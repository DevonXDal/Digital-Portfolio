        <p-tabPanel header="Professional" class="bg-primary">
          <p class="mb-3">I recently graduated from <span class="fancy-underline" title="West Virginia University at Parkersburg">WVUP</span> (May 2023) with a bachelors in software engineering. I had a 4.0 GPA for my associate degree in computer science and a 3.9 GPA for my bachelors. Now that I have graduated I am continuing to improve my skills, particularly with getting better at Angular and learning React.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">Most of my related learning started back in 2017 when I went to the Caperton Center during my junior and senior high school years for Computer System Repair. As time progressed, I went from barely participating in any of the hands-on projects that needed to be completed for the Caperton Center's staff to participating in every project I had the time for. This led to me being awarded a plaque: 'Outstanding Senior 2019.' In the two year span that I went to the Caperton Center, I had joined the <span class="fancy-underline" title="National Technical Honors Society">NTHS</span>, got a <span class="fancy-underline" title="National Occupational Competency and Testing Institute">NOCTI</span> competency credential, and got nine certifications.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">During my associate degree, I learned at least some degree of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, Python, Dart, and most importantly, C# (.NET Core 2.1+). During my sophomore year, I discovered that I wanted to do web development following my graduation. In my capstone class, I studied for and got my <span class="fancy-underline" title="Microsoft Technology Associate">MTA</span> for Software Development Fundamentals During the second half of my sophomore year and into the following summer, I partipated in the college's LearnAndEarn program as student worker intern and worked to create a customer-facing web portal for the college's Reverse Makerspace. In this project, I designed most parts of the system, spoke with the domain experts for feedback, and carried out the development and deployment (Docker and Jenkins) of the system.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">During my bachelors degree, I learned at least some degree of Rust, TypeScript, Blazor, Angular, and SCSS. I massively improved my design documentation skills by learning many design patterns, building larger and more complex <span class="fancy-underline" title="Unified Modeling Language">UML</span> diagrams, data dictionaries, strict and concise language, etc. I also learned introductory level project management skills, which led to me getting the CompTIA Project+ certification. I focused heavily on developing my web development skills, learning not only how to build monolithic web systems but also microservices.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">My most complex but finished project from my college years was the <span class="fancy-underline" title="Customers pay to have makerspace employees use tools such as 3D printers to create various items they want">Reverse Makerspace</span> system. However, even though it was never fully realized due to the extent of work required, my most complex project was my bachelors' capstone. This project included many diagrams and design documentation that was over 200 pages in length. It was meant to be a school messanger app system that was planned to be immensibly customizable and extensible, allowing the userbase to write extensions that mostly could be shared amongst each other to add functionality to their apps that may not otherwise be available. Part of the immense complexity for this project came as it required a web application, a mobile app template, and an extension transpiler. The web application had a mostly working build process that would run on background threads to build the custom mobile apps for each school. The transpiler used a special script that was a bit of a mix between a strict naming syntax and both Bash and Python. The theoretical (never built to its full completion) transpiler was designed to support anything from web data retrieval and display to simple games such as minesweeper or battleship. The app was meant to run through the web, Android, and iOS. Even though it was never finished, it pushed my software engineering skills to a much higher level.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">Now that I have graduated I am continuing to improve my skills, particularly with getting better at Angular and learning React, while I look for work. I am looking for either in-person/hybrid work within the <span class="fancy-underline" title="Mid-Ohio Valley">MOV</span> or remote work for somewhere in the US. I plan to start out as preferebly a backend .NET developer or full-stack web developer, and my goal is to be a software architect in ten years.</p>
