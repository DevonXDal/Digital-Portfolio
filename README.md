# WIP

More information will be included in this README once the portfolio has been deployed. The most recent recent version of the code can be found in the the develop branch and will be found in the main branch when it is ready to be used.

# Who Am I?

My name is Devon Dalrymple and I can be contacted at devonxbusiness@gmail.com. At the time of writing this README (2023-05-19), I have recently finished my final semester of my bachelor's degree at the West Virginia University of Parkersburg, for a BAT in software engineering. I have my associates degree as an AAS for computer science. My GPA is 3.9+. I am creating this digital portfolio to replace one (a Google Web site) that I made back in 2017 before I had even started college. This is being done with intentions to use with finding employment as quickly as reasonably possible.

Most of my experience between personal and school projects is around building Web sites in ASP.NET (started with 2.1 but have experience with 3.1, 5, and 6). This digital portfolio is meant to showcase those skills along with my newly developing skills in Angular (taking an independent study this semester on it along with doing this portfolio to become knowledgable). I have experience with making projects using raw CSS, Bootstrap, Materialize, and Tailwind CSS.

Before college, I went to Williamstown High School. During my Junior and Senior year there, I spent half of my time each school day at the Wood County Caperton Center in the Computer Systems Repair program. I opted to spend my time there working on various computer-related projects around the Caperton Center rather than work on the study material for the TestOut study material, at the cost of doing much of that work as homework. This lead to me getting awarded with a plaque with 'Wood County Technical and Caperton Center Outstanding Senior 2019' inscribed.
